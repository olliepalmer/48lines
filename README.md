# 48lines
This poem is a list of 48 lines from Hollywood films which begin with the word love, stripped of their context, and alphabetically ordered. It is a by-product of a project I was working on training computers to categorise language for a performance at the Paris Opera earlier this year. The result,Â although just computer training data, was oddly poetic, and could be read as a series of snapshots or glimpses of a romantic relationship. 

The lines were compiled from 617 films spanning over 50 years from the [Cornell Movie Dialogs Corpus | http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html]. Films quoted in this reading include Apocalypse Now, Jaws, Sideways, Fargo, Airplane II, Magnolia, Pretty Woman, Austin Powers, Vertigo and more.
