# 48 lines about love from Hollywood films, alphabetically ordered
This poem is a list of 48 lines from Hollywood films which begin with the word love, stripped of their context, and alphabetically ordered. It is a by-product of a project I was working on training computers to categorise language for a performance at the Paris Opera earlier this year. The result, although just computer training data, was oddly poetic, and could be read as a series of snapshots or glimpses of a romantic relationship - and consequently, I used it as a reading during my wedding.

The lines were compiled from 617 films spanning over 50 years from the [Cornell Movie Dialogs Corpus](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html). Films quoted in this reading include Apocalypse Now, Jaws, Sideways, Fargo, Airplane II, Magnolia, Pretty Woman, Austin Powers, Vertigo and more.

I will post the original Python code used to strip metadata and order the file here (which is fast and hacky), along with the 304,446-line master text file it spits out. But perhaps once I'm back from honeymooning. :)
